### 1. Structured Concurrency and the Myth of Multithreading
- **Date:** 2024-10-28
- **Location:** Hop'n Roll / Curitiba-PR 
- **Description:** Explores the differences between IO-bound and CPU-bound tasks and their implications for modern computing. It covers the evolution of blocking versus non-blocking IO, with a focus on how structured concurrency improves efficiency in handling parallel processing tasks. Advanced topics such as thread pools, context management, and concurrency control mechanisms (such as channels, mutexes, and semaphores) are also discussed, providing insights into optimizing concurrent programming.
